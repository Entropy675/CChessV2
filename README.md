# CChessV2

Version 2 of CChess Engine. Built with a lot more experience, right from the start.

Instructions:
- Make the program at root (it will also call the makefile in the linuxclient file).
- Run the chess engine (CChess) generated at the root.
- Connect to the chess engine with a client (only available one right now is linuxclient).
