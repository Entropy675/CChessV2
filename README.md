# CChessV2
Version 2 of CChess Engine. Built with a lot more experience, right from the start.

Currently, make the program at root (it will also call the makefile in the linuxclient file).
Then run the chess engine (CChess) generated at the root.
Then connect to the chess engine with a client (only available one right now is linuxclient).
